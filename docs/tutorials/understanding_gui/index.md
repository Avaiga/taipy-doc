## Before we begin

Only Taipy has to be installed. **Taipy** package requires Python 3.8 or newer;

``` console

    [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
    can guide you through the process.

## Using Notebooks

This **Getting Started** is for Python scripts (*.py*) only. If you want to use **Jupyter Notebooks**, download this [notebook](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting-started-gui/getting_started.ipynb).
