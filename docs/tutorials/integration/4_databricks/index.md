Integrating Taipy with Databricks is a great way to build user-centric applications. 
Taipy GUIs and SDM (Scenario and Data Management) will transform your Databricks models 
into interactive, production-ready applications for end-users.

!!! note "Available in Taipy Enterprise edition"

    The documentation pages for connecting Taipy and Databricks are provided as 
    part of Taipy Enterprise.

The Enterprise documentation demonstrates how to integrate Taipy scenarios with 
Databricks jobs. Taipy's scenarios serve as a potent tool for orchestrating tasks and 
performing 'what-if' analysis (i.e. examining various versions of a business problem).
