You only need one line of code to create your first Taipy web page. Just create a `Gui^`
object with a string and run it.

In the console, you'll find a client link. All you need to do is copy and paste it into
your web browser to open your first Taipy page!


```python
from taipy import Gui

Gui(page="# Getting started with *Taipy*").run(debug=True) # use_reloader=True
```

The run method accepts different useful parameters:

- _debug_: instructs Taipy to operate in debug mode. This means Taipy will provide a
stack trace of the errors within the applicationâ€”a valuable feature during
development.

- _use_reloader_: By default, the page won't refresh on its own after you make a code
modification. If you want to alter this behavior, you can set the *use_reloader* to
True. The application will automatically reload when you make changes to a file in
your application and save it.

- _port_: If you wish to run multiple servers concurrently, you can modify the server
port number (5000 by default).

Other parameters of the `run()` method can be found
[here](../../../../manuals/userman/configuration/gui-config.md#configuring-the-gui-instance).
