# Getting Started with Taipy Core

!!! important "Supported Python versions"

    Taipy requires **Python 3.8** or newer.

Welcome to the **Getting Started Core** guide for Taipy Core. This tour shows you how to use Taipy Core.


# Taipy Core

Taipy Core is one of the components of Taipy to facilitate pipeline orchestration. There are a lot of reasons for using Taipy Core:

- Taipy Core efficiently manages the execution of your functions/pipelines.

- Taipy Core manages data sources and monitors KPIs.

- Taipy Core provides easy management of multiple pipelines and end-user scenarios, which comes in handy in the context of Machine Learning or Mathematical optimization.

Each step of the **"Getting Started Core"** will focus on basic concepts of *Taipy Core*. Note that every step is dependent on the code of the previous one. After completing the last step, you will have the skills to develop your own Taipy 
application. 

## Before we begin

Only Taipy has to be installed. **Taipy** package requires Python 3.8 or newer;

``` console
$ pip install taipy
```

!!! info 

    `pip install taipy` is the preferred method to install the latest stable version of Taipy.
    
    If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this 
    [Python installation guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
    can guide you through the process.

## Using Notebooks

This **Getting Started** is for Python scripts (*.py*) only. If you want to use **Jupyter Notebooks**, download this [notebook](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/getting_started/getting-started-core/getting_started.ipynb).

## Taipy Studio

There are two ways to configure Taipy Core, either by Python code or with Taipy Studio. We strongly recommend using Taipy Studio. 

Taipy Studio is a VS Code extension that provides a graphical editor to describe pipelines. The configuration of Taipy Core can be done more easily and quickly through Taipy Studio.

So, without further delay, let's begin to code!
