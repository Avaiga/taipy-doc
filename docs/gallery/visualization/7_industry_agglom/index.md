# Understanding the Application

Traditionally, industrial agglomeration is measured using a metric called Location 
Quotient (LQ). This metric is simple but has its limits. For example, less populated 
and remote counties will sometimes have high LQs, despite having low employment counts. 
This [paper](https://www.statsamerica.org/downloads/user-guides/user-guide-PALQ.pdf){target='blank'} proposes a new metric to resolve these issues called Proximity Adjusted 
Location Quotients (PA-LQ or CLQ).

In this demo, you can explore LQs and CLQs for different industries and counties and 
notice the differences in the results.
