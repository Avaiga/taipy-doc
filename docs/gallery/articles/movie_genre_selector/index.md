# Understanding the Application

This demo illustrates Taipy's capability to analyze CSV files
and present compelling insights. This demonstration uses Taipy
full functionality since it involves building a front-end and a
back-end. Here, the backend involves the execution of a very simple
pipeline (made of a single task). Note that Taipy is designed to build
much more complex pipelines (with many tasks)!
The pipeline (referred as ‘scenario’ in Taipy) here filters the movie
data based on the selected genre. Whenever you modify the genre selection,
the pipeline will automatically run and display a chart presenting the seven
most popular movies within that genre.

# How to Use Taipy for Genre Selection

To explore and select movie genres, follow these simple steps:

1. Choose your favorite genre on the scrolling menu.
2. Enjoy seven personalized movie recommendations based on your genre choices.
