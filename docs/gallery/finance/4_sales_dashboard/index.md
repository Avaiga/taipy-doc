This demo allows users to extract data from an Excel file/CSV and derive meaningful insights.
The data is a list of transactions done by different branches in a company. Sales are
made in different cities, and each one is evaluated through ratings. The data also
contains more information, like the gender or type of customer.

Different visualizations are shown, from maps to sales bar charts including a page to
filter and analyze the sales data.
