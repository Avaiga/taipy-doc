# Understanding the Application

This application allows users to enter a prompt to manipulate or visualize data such
as "Plot sales by product line in a pie chart" and the app will generate the
appropriate visualization.

This works by calling a quantized version of HuggingFace's StarCoder code generation
LLM model hosted on Azure. The user prompt entered on the Taipy app gets sent to the
model, which uses few-shot learning to generate pandas code to manipulate the data and
Taipy code to create the visualization.
