You can check your current installed version of Taipy by running the `taipy --version` (or
`taipy -v`) command in a terminal (Linux, macOS) or command prompt (Windows).

```console
$ taipy --version
Taipy 2.3.0
```

If you don't see a supported version of Taipy, you'll need to either upgrade Taipy or
perform a fresh install, as described in the
[Installation page](../../../tutorials/getting_started/installation.md).
