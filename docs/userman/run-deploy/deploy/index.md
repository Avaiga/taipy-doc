When you have developed and tested a Taipy application, on your local system, you
may need to deploy it on a remote environment, for end users to be able to use it.

Here are the different situations that Taipy can address:

- [Locally](local/index.md): deploy the application on your local system;
- [Linux](linux/index.md): deploy the application on a server running Linux;
- [Docker](docker/index.md): running the application in a container;
- [Azure](azure/index.md): deploy the application on the
  [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) platform;
- [Heroku](heroku/index.md): deploy the application on the
  [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) platform;
- [Databricks](databricks/index.md): deploy the application on the
  [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) platform;
