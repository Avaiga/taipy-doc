Deploying your Taipy application on your local machine is an occasional use case that can be
considered if you want to temporarily expose an application for remote users over the Internet.

An easy path to follow is to use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), which can open access to remote
systems without having to reconfigure the network settings.<br/>
A step-by-step documentation on how to use Ngrok to deploy a Taipy GUI application can be
found in the [section](../../../advanced_features/configuration/gui-config.md#accessing-your-app-from-the-web) exposing
how to access your application remotely.
