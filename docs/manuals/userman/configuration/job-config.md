The `JobConfig^` allows the developer to configure the Taipy behavior for job executions.
Three modes are available in Taipy: *standalone*, *development*, and *cluster*.

# Development mode

With the *development* mode, the jobs are synchronously executed one by one. The jobs are
directly executed in the main thread at the submission. Note that with the *development* mode,
the submit method waits for the jobs to be finished before to return. Please refer to the
[submit entity](../task-orchestration/scenario-submission.md) section to the see how to submit
jobs.

It is particularly handy to test a job execution and/or investigate an issue in the function
executed.

The *development* mode can be activated with the following config:

=== "Python configuration"

    ```python  linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.configure_job_executions(mode="development")
    ```

=== "TOML configuration"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.load("config.toml")
    ```

    ```toml linenums="1" title="config.toml"
    [JOB]
    mode = "development"
    ```

!!! note

    Note that if no mode is configured, the development mode is used.

# Standalone mode

!!! warning

    We do not encourage using standalone mode in an interactive Python environment
    such as Jupyter Notebook or iPython. However, if you find the need for it, please
    note that when using the standalone mode in an interactive environment context, the
    function to be provided to a task configuration must be defined in a separate Python
    module (or a .py file) and not in the interactive platform. For reference, please visit:
    [multiprocessing - Process-based parallelism](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#using-a-pool-of-workers)

With the *standalone* mode, a `Job^` runs in its own execution context, in an asynchronous
manner. At the submission, the job is queued. It is dequeued in a different thread and sent
to a dedicated process to be executed.
Note that with the *standalone* mode, the `(Scenario.)submit()^` method is not blocking and
returns after the job is queued. It means the submit method can return before the job finishes
or even before it is dequeued. Please refer to the
[submit entity](../task-orchestration/scenario-submission.md) section to the see how to submit
jobs.

You can configure the *standalone* mode with the following config:

=== "Python configuration"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.configure_job_executions(mode="standalone")
    ```

=== "TOML configuration"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.load("config.toml")
    ```

    ```toml linenums="1" title="config.toml"
    [JOB]
    mode = "standalone"
    ```

To execute multiple `Job^`s simultaneously, you can set the *max_nb_of_workers* to an
integer value greater than 1. That starts each `Job^` in a dedicated process with
*max_nb_of_workers* as the limit of concurrent processes that can run simultaneously.

!!! note

    The default value of *max_nb_of_workers* is 2.

For example, the following configuration will allow Taipy to run up to eight `Job^`s
simultaneously:

=== "Python configuration"

    ```python  linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.configure_job_executions(mode="standalone", max_nb_of_workers=8)
    ```

=== "TOML configuration "

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.load("config.toml")
    ```

    ```toml linenums="1" title="config.toml"
    [JOB]
    mode = "standalone"
    max_nb_of_workers = "8:int"
    ```

# Cluster mode

!!! warning "Available in Taipy Enterprise edition"

    This section is relevant only to the Enterprise edition of Taipy.

The *cluster* mode is designed to make Taipy applications execute jobs on a remote
cluster of distributed workers. The number of machines available in the cluster is
unlimited, so the application becomes fully scalable horizontally. It can also be
adjusted dynamically depending on some load metrics.

With the *cluster* mode, a `Job^` asynchronously runs in its own environment. When
submitted, the job is queued in a RabbitMQ queue. When there is a worker available,
the job is dequeued and sent to the worker environment to be executed.

Note that with the *cluster* mode, the `(Scenario.)submit()^` method is not blocking
and returns after the job is queued. This means the `submit()` method can return before
the job finishes or even before it is dequeued. Please refer to the
[submit entity](../task-orchestration/scenario-submission.md) section on how to submit
jobs.

You can configure the *cluster* mode with the following config:

=== "Python configuration"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.configure_job_executions(mode="cluster")
    ```

=== "TOML configuration"

    ```python linenums="1"
    from taipy import Config

    Config.load("config.toml")
    ```

    ```toml linenums="1" title="config.toml"
    [JOB]
    mode = "cluster"
    ```

To set up a worker environment, some requirements must be met:

- The workers must have access to the same Taipy application as the main environment.
- The main application and the workers must have the same Python environment.
- The main application and the workers must have access to the same RabbitMQ server.
- The main application and the workers must have access to the data referenced by
  the data nodes. This includes:
  - The shared drive(s) containing the data for file-based data nodes.
  - The database server(s) containing the data for database-based data nodes.

To start the worker service in the worker environment, you can use the following command:

```console
$ taipy run-worker --application-path /path/to/your/taipy/application
```
where you can provide the path to the Taipy application. The default path is the current
working directory. The worker service will start and listen to the RabbitMQ queue for
incoming jobs.

!!! note "Number of worker environments"

    The number of active worker environments limits the number of concurrent jobs that
    can run simultaneously.

    If there is no worker available, the job is queued in the RabbitMQ queue until a worker
    is available.
