Examples of using Taipy event notifications to capture and consume *events*.

# Real-Time GUI Updates with Taipy Event Consumers

This script defines a custom event consumer class `SpecificCoreConsumer`, which listens
for all events published by Taipy Core and triggers GUI notification based on those events.
It includes determining if the event is published from a `Scenario^` entity or `DataNode^` entity
and if the action is `CREATION^` or `UPDATE^`.

!!! example
    ```python linenums="1"
    {%
    include-markdown "./code-example/user-changes-notifier.py"
    comments=false
     %}
    ```

    This snippet shows a how you can capture and process events to notify user whenever
    a new scenario is created or the value of a data node is updated.

# External API triggered with Taipy Event Consumers

This script defines a custom event consumer class `JobFailureCoreConsumer`, which listens
for all events published by Taipy Core, when a `JOB^` entity's `status` attribute is `UPDATE`,
and triggers an external API call based on the `JOB^`'s `id`.

!!! example
    ```python linenums="1"
    {%
    include-markdown "./code-example/external-api-call-notifier.py"
    comments=false
     %}
    ```

    This snippet shows a how you can capture and process `JOB^` events when an `UPDATE` is made to the `status`
    of the `JOB^` and request an external API.
