# Cycle creation

A `Cycle^` creation is indirectly triggered by the scenario creation method.

TODO
- Cross-reference to the scenario configuration and scenario creation.

# Cycle attributes

A cycle is identified by a unique identifier `id` that was generated by Taipy. A cycle also holds various
attributes and properties, each accessible as an attribute of the cycle:

-   _**frequency**_ corresponds to the cycle `Frequency^`. It is populated at the cycle creation using the
    scenario frequency that triggered the cycle creation.
-   _**creation_date**_ corresponds to the date-time of the creation of this cycle.
-   _**start_date**_ corresponds to the date and time of the start of this cycle.
-   _**end_date**_ corresponds to the date and time of the end of this cycle.
-   _**name**_ corresponds to a user readable name of this cycle.
-   Each property of the _**properties'**_ dictionary is also directly exposed as an attribute.

!!! example

    ```python linenums="1"
    import taipy as tp
    from datetime import datetime
    import my_config

    scenario = tp.create_scenario(my_config.monthly_scenario_cfg,
                                  creation_date=datetime(2022, 1, 3))
    cycle = scenario.cycle

    # The frequency is an attribute of the cycle. In the example, it equals
    # Frequency.MONTHLY since my_config.monthly_scenario_cfg is used has been
    # used to instantiate scenario and cycle.
    cycle.frequency
    # The creation date is the date-time provided at the creation. It equals datetime(2022, 1, 3)
    cycle.creation_date
    # The start date is the date-time of the start of the cycle. It equals datetime(2022, 1, 1)
    cycle.start_date
    # The end date is the date-time of the end of the cycle. It equals datetime(2022, 1, 31)
    cycle.end_date
    # By default, the `name` is generated. It can be set manually.
    cycle.name = "January cycle"
    ```

# Get a cycle by id

The basic method to get a cycle is from its id by using the `taipy.get()^` method:

```python linenums="1"
import taipy as tp
import my_config

scenario = tp.create_scenario(my_config.monthly_scenario_cfg)
cycle = scenario.cycle
cycle_retrieved = tp.get(cycle.id)
cycle == cycle_retrieved
```

Here, the two variables `cycle` and `cycle_retrieved` are equal.

# Get all cycles

All the cycles can be retrieved using the method `taipy.get_cycles()^`. This method returns the list of all
existing cycles.

# Delete a cycle

A cycle can be deleted by using `taipy.delete()^` which takes the cycle id as a parameter. The deletion is also
propagated to the nested scenarios, sequences, tasks, data nodes, and jobs if they are not shared with any other
cycles.
