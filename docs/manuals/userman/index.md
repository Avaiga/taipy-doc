# Scenario and Data Management - `taipy.core`

The `taipy.core^` package is a Python library designed to build powerful and customized
data-driven back-end applications. It provides the necessary tools to help Python developers
transform their algorithms into a complete back-end application.

Taipy Core brings algorithm management to another level: algorithms are now connected to the
end-user through user-defined scenarios, interactive data, smart job orchestration, etc.

# Taipy REST - `taipy.rest`

The `taipy.rest` package allows you to access Taipy Core functionalities such as scenarios
management, sequences and task orchestration, data management, etc., through a dedicated REST API.
This package aims to provide a solution to easily integrate Taipy applications with other IT
systems. The API comes with multiple endpoints for you to work with Taipy Core conveniently and
efficiently.
