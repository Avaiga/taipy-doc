# About Taipy's User Manual

This User Manual covers all the topics and concepts that you can find in Taipy.
For each topic, we are trying to provide as many examples as possible so that
you as a Taipy user can perform a specific task.

If you are just starting with Taipy, you may want to look at the [Getting Started document](../getting_started/installation.md)
in order to see a step-by-step example of a complete Taipy application.


## Graphical User Interface

Taipy comes with a package (`taipy.gui^`) that allows for building user interfaces. The
Graphical User Interface (GUI) section will provide you with all the information
you need to create pages that you can display and interact with.

## Taipy Core

The Taipy Core package is a python library made to build powerful and customized data-driven back-end applications.
It provides the necessary tools to help data scientists transform their algorithms into a complete
back-end application.

Taipy Core brings algorithm management to another level: algorithms are now connected to the end-user through
user-defined scenarios, interactive data, smart scheduling, etc.
