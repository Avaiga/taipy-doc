## Taipy Core - `taipy.core`

The `taipy.core^` package is a python library made to create complete back-end applications
around decision-making
algorithms. It provides the necessary tools to help data scientists transform their algorithms into a complete
back-end application, so they can quickly and easily put it into their end user's hands. Thanks to Taipy core, data
scientists are more autonomous. They can focus on their core skills: building the best algorithms to solve their
business problems.
