# About Taipy's User Manual

This User Manual covers all the topics and concepts that you can find in Taipy.
For each topic, we are trying to provide as many examples as possible so that
you as a Taipy user can perform a specific task.

If you are just starting with Taipy, you may want to look at the [Getting Started document](../getting_started/installation.md)
in order to see a complete example of a complete Taipy application, described step-by-step.

## Taipy Core

The Taipy core package is a python library made to create complete back-end applications around decision-making
algorithms. It provides the necessary tools to help data scientists transform their algorithms into a complete
back-end application, so they can quickly and easily put it into their end user's hands. Thanks to Taipy core, data
scientists are more autonomous. They can focus on their core skills: building the best algorithms to solve their
business problems.

## Graphical User Interface

Taipy comes with a package (`taipy.gui`) that allows for building user interfaces. The
Graphical User Interface (GUI) section will provide you with all the information
you need to create pages that you can display and interact with.
