## Taipy Core - `taipy.core`

The `taipy.core^` package is a Python library made to build powerful and customized data-driven back-end applications.

Taipy Core brings algorithm management to another level: algorithms are now connected to the end-user through
user-defined scenarios, interactive data, smart scheduling, etc.
