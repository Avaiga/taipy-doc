Allows uploading a file content.

The upload can be triggered by pressing a button, or drag-and-dropping a file on top of the control.

# Styling

All the file selector controls are generated with the "taipy-file_selector" CSS class. You can use this class
name to select the file selector controls on your page and apply style.

# Usage

## Default behavior

The variable specified in _content_ is populated by a local filename when the transfer is completed.

!!! taipy-element
    default={content}

## Standard configuration

The [*label*](#p-label) property can be set to a label shown besides the standard icon.<br/>
The function name provided as [*on_action*](#p-on_action) is called when the transfer is
completed.<br/>
The [*extensions*](#p-extensions) property can be used as a list of file name extensions that is
used to filter the file selection box. This filter is not enforced: the user can select and upload
any file.<br/>
Upon dragging a file over the button, the value of the [*drop_message*](#p-drop_message) property
is displayed as a temporary label for the button.

!!! taipy-element
    default={content}
    label=Download File
    on_action:f=function_name
    extensions=.csv,.xlsx
    drop_message=Drop Message

## Multiple files upload

The user can transfer multiple files at once by setting the [*multiple*](#p-multiple) property to
True.

!!! taipy-element
    default={content}
    multiple:b=True
