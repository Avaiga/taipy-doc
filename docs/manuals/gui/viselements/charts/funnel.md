# Funnel charts

Funnel charts represent series of decreasing values as shrinking stacked bars.

Funnel charts are typically used:

- To visualize the changed value at each stage of a process.
- To estimate a potential figure at every stage.
- To track conversion and retention rates.
- To reveal bottlenecks in a linear process.
- To track shopping cart workflows.
- To track the progress and success of click-through advertising and marketing campaigns.

To create a funnel chart in Taipy, you must set the [*type*](../chart.md#p-type) property
of the chart control "funnel" or "funnelarea".

## Key properties

| Name            | Value           | Notes   |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [*type*](../chart.md#p-type)      | `funnel` or `funnelarea`  |  |
| [*x*](../chart.md#p-x)            | Volume values for stages  | For the `funnel` type.  |
| [*y*](../chart.md#p-y)            | Stage names  | For the `funnel` type.  |
| [*values*](../chart.md#p-values)  | Volume values for stages  | For the `funnelarea` type.  |
| [*text*](../chart.md#p-text)      | Stage names  | For the `funnelarea` type.  |
| [*marker*](../chart.md#p-marker)  | dictionary  | `color` can be used to indicate the color of the box representing a stage. It can refer to the name of a column in *data* what would hold color definitions.<br/>`line` provides the parameters for styling the box frames. |
| [*options*](../chart.md#p-options)  | dictionary  | `connector` can be used to customize the graphical properties of the lines connecting the boxes. |

## Examples

### Simple funnel chart {data-source="gui:doc/examples/charts/funnel-simple"}

Here is an example of how to visualize a typical Sales process, looking at how
many sale opportunities make it through, from the number of leads down to the
number of actual sales.

The data set is pretty simple:

```py
data = {
    "Opps":  ["Hot leads", "Doc sent", "Quote", "Closed Won"],
    "Visits": [316, 238, 125, 83]
}
```

So from 316 leads, the company could retain 238 document exchanges, then 125 quotes.
Finally, 83 opportunities were converted to actual close deals.

In a Taipy funnel chart, the type of stage must be stored in the [*y*](../chart.md#p-y)
property, and the volume in the [*x*](../chart.md#p-x) property of the chart control:

!!! example "Page content"

    === "Markdown"

        ```
        <|{data}|chart|type=funnel|x=Visits|y=Opps|>
        ```
  
    === "HTML"

        ```html
        <taipy:chart type="funnel" x="Visits" y="Opps">{data}</taipy:chart>
        ```

The resulting chart looks like this:

<figure>
    <img src="../funnel-simple-d.png" class="visible-dark" />
    <img src="../funnel-simple-l.png" class="visible-light"/>
    <figcaption>Simple funnel chart</figcaption>
</figure>


### Multiple traces {data-source="gui:doc/examples/charts/funnel-multiple"}

With the previous example, we could spot how many contacts would convert to sales,
globally for a company.<br/>
We can split this information into Regions and get more detailed conversion
information.

In the following code, we have the same information spread across regions:

```py
data = {
    # The stage names
    "Types": ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Prospects", "Invoice sent", "Closed"],
    # Volume for each stage, in the US
    "Visits_us": [13873, 10533, 5443, 2703, 908],
    # Volume for each stage, in the EU
    "Visits_eu": [ 7063, 4533, 3443, 1003, 1208 ],
    # Volume for each stage, in the AP region
    "Visits_ap": [ 6873, 2533, 3443, 1703, 508 ]
}

# Columns for each trace
x = ["Visits_us", "Visits_eu", "Visits_ap"]

# Legend text for each trace
names = ["US", "EU", "AP"]
```

*x* is an array of the entries in the data set that we use as the
value of the [*x*](../chart.md#p-x) property of the chart control.<br/>
It is a shortcut to setting each [*x[]*](../chart.md#p-x) value, where we
would have had to write, in the chart definition, the pretty long:
`x[1]=Visits_us|x[2]=Visits_eu|x[3]=Visits_ap`, and even longer in HTML.

The *names* variable holds all the trace names, so they appear properly in the chart
legend.

!!! example "Page content"

    === "Markdown"

        ```
        <|{data}|chart|type=funnel|x={x}|y=Types|name={names}|>
        ```
  
    === "HTML"

        ```html
        <taipy:chart type="funnel" x="{x}" y="Types" name="{names}">{data}</taipy:chart>
        ```
The resulting chart looks like this:

<figure>
    <img src="../funnel-multiple-d.png" class="visible-dark" />
    <img src="../funnel-multiple-l.png" class="visible-light"/>
    <figcaption>Funnel chart with multiple traces</figcaption>
</figure>

### Styling {data-source="gui:doc/examples/charts/funnel-styling"}

Taipy lets you customize how the funnel chart elements can be styled.<br/>
To indicate how bars and lines should look, use the
[*marker*](../chart.md#p-marker) and [*options*](../chart.md#p-options) properties
of the chart control.

Here is some code that shows how styling can be customized:

```py
data = {
    "Types":  ["Website visit", "Downloads", "Prospects", "Invoice sent", "Closed"],
    "Visits": [13873, 10533, 5443, 2703, 908]
}

marker = {
    # Boxes are filled with a blue gradient color
    "color": ["hsl(210,50%,50%)", "hsl(210,60%,60%)", "hsl(210,70%,70%)", "hsl(210,80%,80%)", "hsl(210,90%,90%)"],
    # Lines get thicker, with an orange-to-green gradient color
    "line": {
        "width": [ 1, 1, 2, 3, 4 ],
        "color": ["f5720a", "f39c1d", "f0cc3d", "aadb12", "8cb709"]
    }
}

options = {
    # Lines connecting boxes are thick, dotted and green
    "connector": {
        "line": {
            "color": "green",
            "dash": "dot",
            "width": 4
        }
    }
}
```

The definition of the chart control references the two dictionaries that we have set up:

!!! example "Page content"

    === "Markdown"

        ```
        <|{data}|chart|type=funnel|x=Visits|y=Types|marker={marker}|options={options}|>
        ```
  
    === "HTML"

        ```html
        <taipy:chart type="funnel" x="Visits" y="Types"
            marker="{marker}" options="{options}">{data}</taipy:chart>
        ```

And here is how the resulting funnel chart is displayed:

<figure>
    <img src="../funnel-styling-d.png" class="visible-dark" />
    <img src="../funnel-styling-l.png" class="visible-light" />

### Funnel area chart {data-source="gui:doc/examples/charts/funnel-area"}

A funnel area chart is a kind of funnel chart where boxes, instead of being represented
as rectangles, appear as stacked trapezoids.<br/>
The width of the funnel area, as it narrows, indicates the percentage of global volume
at each stage of the process.

To have Taipy create a funnel area chart, we must set the chart
[*type*](../chart.md#p-type) to "funnelarea" and set the *funnel* property of
[*layout*](../chart.md#p-layout) to "stack".<br/>
Also note that, in the chart control definition, the stage names are set to
the [*text*](../chart.md#p-text) property, and the stage volumes are set
to [*values*](../chart.md#p-values) (instead of [*y*](../chart.md#p-y) and
[*x*](../chart.md#p-x)).

Here is some code that demonstrates how to create a funnel area chart with Taipy:

```py
data = {
    "Types":  ["Visits", "Downloads", "Prospects", "Invoiced", "Closed"],
    "Visits": [13873, 10533, 5443, 2703, 908]
}

layout = {
    # Stack the areas
    "funnelmode": "stack",
    # Hide the legend
    "showlegend": False
}
```

Notice that, in the chart control definition, the stage names are set to
the [*text*](../chart.md#p-text) property and the stage volume values are set
to [*values*](../chart.md#p-values):

!!! example "Page content"

    === "Markdown"

        ```
        <|{data}|chart|type=funnelarea|values=Visits|text=Types|layout={layout}|>
        ```
  
    === "HTML"

        ```html
        <taipy:chart type="funnelarea" values="Visits" text="Types" layout="layout"
            {data}</taipy:chart>
        ```

The funnel area chart we just created looks like this:

<figure>
    <img src="../funnel-area-d.png" class="visible-dark" />
    <img src="../funnel-area-l.png" class="visible-light" />
    <figcaption>Funnel area chart</figcaption>
</figure>

### Multiple funnel charts {data-source="gui:doc/examples/charts/funnel-area-multiple"}

You can create a chart control that represents several funnel charts: Taipy
lets use of the *domain* property set to the definition of a location
box in the [*options*](../chart.md#p-options) property of the control.

Here is a complete example where we display, in the same chart, a funnel area chart
for two sales pipes, in two regions, resulting in four traces being generated:

```py
data = {
    "John_us": [500, 450, 340, 230, 220, 110],
    "John_eu": [600, 500, 400, 300, 200, 100],
    "Robert_us": [510, 480, 440, 330, 220, 100],
    "Robert_eu": [360, 250, 240, 130, 120, 60],
}

# Values for each trace
values = ["John_us", "John_eu", "Robert_us", "Robert_eu"]

options = [
    # For John/US
    {
        "scalegroup": "first",
        "textinfo": "value",
        "title": {
            # "position": "top",
            "text": "John in the U.S."
        },
        # Lower-left corner
        "domain": {"x": [0, 0.5], "y": [0, 0.5]}
    },
    # For John/EU
    {
        "scalegroup": "first",
        "textinfo": "value",
        "title": {
            # "position": "top",
            "text": "John in the E.U."
        },
        # Upper-left corner
        "domain": {"x": [0, 0.5], "y": [0.55, 1]}
    },
    # For Robert/US
    {
        "scalegroup": "second",
        "textinfo": "value",
        "title": {
            #"position": "top",
            "text": "Robert in the U.S."
        },
        # Lower-right corner
        "domain": {"x": [0.51, 1], "y": [0, 0.5]}
    },
    # For Robert/EU
    {
        "scalegroup": "second",
        "textinfo": "value",
        "title": {
            # "position": "top",
            "text": "Robert in the E.U."
        },
        # Upper-right corner
        "domain": {"x": [0.51, 1], "y": [0.51, 1]}
    }
]

layout = {
    "title": "Sales per Salesman per Region",
    "showlegend": False,
    # Draw frames around each trace
    "shapes": [
        { "x0": 0,    "x1": 0.5, "y0": 0,    "y1": 0.5 },
        { "x0": 0,    "x1": 0.5, "y0": 0.52, "y1": 1 },
        { "x0": 0.52, "x1": 1,   "y0": 0,    "y1": 0.5 },
        { "x0": 0.52, "x1": 1,   "y0": 0.52, "y1": 1 }
    ]
}
```

The *options* array holds the settings for each trace. In particular, see how
the *domain* property defines an area within the overall chart area where this
specific trace should be rendered.

!!! example "Page content"

    === "Markdown"

        ```
        <|{data}|chart|type=funnelarea|values={values}|options={options}|layout={layout}|>
        ```
  
    === "HTML"

        ```html
        <taipy:chart type="funnelarea" values="{values}"
            options="{options}" layout="layout">
            {data}</taipy:chart>
        ```

This is the resulting chart:
