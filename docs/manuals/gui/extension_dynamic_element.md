# Dynamic elements

To add variable binding to custom elements, you must create dynamic elements.

Dynamic elements use JavaScript code to dynamically generate HTML code to
produce the pages that can be displayed in a browser. Taipy GUI actually relies
of the [React](https://reactjs.org/) JavaScript library to simplify the
development of graphical components.

!!! warning "Work in Progress"
    This section still requires significant work, which is in progress.
    At this time, Taipy GUI provides a custom element library example
    with lengthy explanations on how to build it.<br/>
    Please look into the `doc/extension` directory where Taipy GUI is
    installed for more information.<br/>
    You can also look at this example directly on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy-gui/tree/develop/doc/extension).
