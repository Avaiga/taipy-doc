# Support for Taipy GUI Markdown syntax

The Taipy Studio extension provides a specific kind of support for
[IntelliSense](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/using-intellisense)
in the context of writing
[Markdown text for Taipy GUI](../gui/pages.md#using-markdown).<br/>
Taipy Studio will help you complete constructs needed to define visual elements
and even propose code elements (such as variable or function names) that the
element might use. In this regard, Taipy Studio provides a kind of code
completion service, for the Taipy GUI Markdown syntax.

This feature is activated when you enter Markdown content:

- In a Markdown file (the filename extension must be `.md`);
- In any string that appears in Python source code.

Beside the IntelliSense service, Taipy Studio also reports, in the *Problems*
view, warnings and errors it finds in your Markdown content.
