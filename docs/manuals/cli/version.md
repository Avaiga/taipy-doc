# Get Taipy version
You can check your current installed version of Taipy by running the `taipy --version` (or 
`taipy -v`) command in a terminal (Linux, macOS) or command prompt (Windows).

```console
$ taipy --version
Taipy 2.3.0
```

If you don't see a supported version of Taipy, you'll need to either upgrade Taipy or perform a
fresh install, as described in the [Installation page](../../installation/index.md).
