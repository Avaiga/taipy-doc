The **Taipy version management system** allows a Taipy user to track and manage various versions
of its application. To use the version management system, one can run the `$ taipy manage-versions`
command in a terminal (Linux, macOS) or command prompt (Windows).

Below is the list of all the optional arguments:

- **--help** or **-h**: Shows the help message and exits.

- **--list** or **-l**: Lists all existing versions of the Taipy application and exits.

- **--rename OLD_VERSION NEW_VERSION**: Rename the provided old version name to the new one.

- **--compare-config VERSION_1 VERSION_2**: Compare the configuration of version 1 and version 2.
  Show the configuration differences and exits.

- **--delete VERSION** or **-d VERSION**: Deletes the provided version and its entities.

- **--delete-production VERSION** or **-dp VERSION**: Converts the provided production version
  to an experiment version.


# Help

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --list            List all existing versions of the Taipy application.
  --rename OLD_VERSION NEW_VERSION
                        Rename a Taipy version.
  --compare-config VERSION_1 VERSION_2
                        Compare the Configuration of 2 Taipy versions.
  -d VERSION, --delete VERSION

  -dp VERSION, --delete-production VERSION
                        Delete a Taipy version from production by version number. The version is
                        still kept as an experiment version.
```

# List all versions

To list all versions of your Taipy Core application, you can run the version management command
with `--list` or `-l` option.

```console
$ taipy manage-versions --list
Version number                         Mode                   Creation date
d74ec95e-6b98-4612-b50b-d171599fa3e9   Development (latest)   2023-01-19 14:45:10
3.0                                    Experiment             2023-01-18 12:10:55
2.0                                    Production             2023-01-16 15:10:41
7a24dbb8-bdf6-4c84-9ddf-7b921abc5df9   Experiment             2023-01-16 17:10:15

```

In the example above, there are 5 versions of the application:

- The development version "d74ec95e-6b98-4612-b50b-d171599fa3e9" which is also the latest version used.
- Two experiment versions "7a24dbb8-bdf6-4c84-9ddf-7b921abc5df9" and "3.0".
- Two production versions "1.0" and "2.0".

# Rename a version

To rename a version, you can run the version management command with `--rename` option, providing
the current version name and the new desired name.

```console
$ taipy manage-versions --list
Version number                         Mode                   Creation date
d74ec95e-6b98-4612-b50b-d171599fa3e9   Development (latest)   2023-01-19 14:45:10

1.0                                    Experiment             2023-01-12 09:10:35

$ taipy manage-versions --rename 2.0 1.1
Successfully renamed version '2.0' to '1.1'.

$ taipy manage-versions --list
Version number                         Mode                   Creation date
d74ec95e-6b98-4612-b50b-d171599fa3e9   Development (latest)   2023-01-19 14:45:10
1.1                                    Experiment             2023-01-16 15:10:41
1.0                                    Experiment             2023-01-12 09:10:35
```

!!! Warning

    You can not use an existing version as the new version name, since it may cause different
    versions to overlap each other.

# Compare the configuration of 2 versions

To compare the configuration between 2 versions, you can run the version management command with `--compare-config` option, providing the two version names.

```console
$ taipy manage-versions --compare-config 1.0 2.0
[2023-01-25 12:52:05,484][Taipy][INFO] Differences between version 1.0 Configuration and version 2.0 Configuration:
Added object:
        DATA_NODE "output" has attribute "description" added: What a description
```
In this example, from the comparison output, we can see that the data node "output" of version 2.0
has a newly added attribute named "description".

# Delete a version

To delete a version, you can run the version management command with `--delete` or `-d` option.

```console
$ taipy manage-versions --list

with `--delete-production` option.
