In this section, it is assumed that [`my_config.py`](../my_config.py) module contains a Taipy configuration
already implemented.

Tasks get created when scenarios or pipelines are created. Please refer to the
[Entities' creation](scenario-creation.md) section for more details.

# Task attributes
Now that we assume to know how to create a new `Task^`, this section focuses on describing the task's attributes and
utility methods for using tasks.

A `Task^` entity is identified by a unique identifier `id` that is generated by Taipy.
A task also holds various properties accessible as an attribute of the task:

-   _**config_id**_ is the id of the scenario configuration.
-   _**function**_ is the function that will take data from input data nodes and return data that should go
    inside the output data nodes.
-   _**input**_ is the list of input data nodes.
-   _**output**_ is the list of output data nodes.

!!! Example

    ```python linenums="1"
    import taipy as tp
    import my_config

    scenario = tp.create_scenario(my_config.monthly_scenario_cfg)
    task = scenario.predicting

    # the config_id is an attribute of the task and equals "task_configuration"
    task.config_id

    # the function which is going to be executed with input data nodes and return value on output data nodes.
    task.function # predict

    # input is the list of input data nodes of the task
    task.input # [trained_model_cfg, current_month_cfg]

    # output is the list of input data nodes of the task
    task.output # [trained_model_cfg]

    # the current_month data node entity is exposed as an attribute of the task
    current_month_data_node = task.current_month
    ```

Taipy exposes multiple methods to manage the various tasks.

# Get Tasks

The first method to get a job is from its id by using the `taipy.get()^` method

```python linenums="1"
import taipy as tp
import my_config

scenario = tp.create_scenario(my_config.monthly_scenario_cfg)
task = scenario.training
task_retrieved = tp.get(task.id)
# task == task_retrieved
```

Here, the two variables `task` and `task_retrieved` are equal.

A task can also be retrieved from a scenario or a pipeline, by accessing the task config_id attribute.

```python linenums="1"
task_1 = scenario.predicting
pipeline = scenario.sales
task_2 - pipeline.predicting
# task_1 == task_2
```

All the jobs can be retrieved using the method `taipy.get_tasks()^`.
