# Taipy Core

The Taipy Core package is a python library designed to build powerful and customized data-driven back-end applications.
It provides the necessary tools to help Python developers transform their algorithms into a complete
back-end application.

Taipy Core brings algorithm management to another level: algorithms are now connected to the end-user through
user-defined scenarios, powerful scenario comparison, interactive data, smart scheduling, etc.
