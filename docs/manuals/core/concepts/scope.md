The `Scope^` of a data node is an enum among the following values :

- `Scope.PIPELINE`
- `Scope.SCENARIO` (Default value)
- `Scope.CYCLE`
- `Scope.GLOBAL`

Each data node has a scope. It is an attribute provided by the
`DataNodeConfig^`.
It represents the _visibility_ of the data node in the graph of entities. Indeed,
the entities can be represented as a graph where each node belongs to one or multiple upper nodes. A data node 'belongs'
to at least one task which belongs to at least one pipeline which belongs to at least one scenario which belongs to a
single cycle.

In other words :

- A data node with the scope equals to `Scope.PIPELINE`, can only be shared by multiple tasks among the same pipeline.
- A data node with the scope equals to `Scope.SCENARIO`, can be shared by multiple tasks and pipelines within a unique
scenario, but it cannot belong to other tasks or pipelines from another scenario.
- A data node with the scope equals to `Scope.CYCLE`, can be shared by all the tasks, pipelines and scenarios from one
cycle, but cannot be shared with tasks, pipelines, scenarios from another cycle.
- A data node with the scope equals to `Scope.GLOBAL`, can be shared by any task, pipeline, scenario, whatever their
cycles.

!!! example

    In our example with two pipelines, we have multiple possibilities. The following pictures represent two examples.
    The scopes are written in green at the bottom of each data node.

    The first picture represents the basic case. We let Taipy apply the default scope (`Scope.PIPELINE`) for most
    data nodes. However, as you can see, the `sales predictions` data node is shared by the two pipelines
    of my scenario. Consequently, its scope cannot be __pipeline__, but must be at least __scenario__.
    In this case, my various scenarios do not share any data node.

    In the second picture, we have a second use case. In this example, we make several changes :

    - The first assumption is that the historical sales are stored in a single system of records. The sales history
    becomes a data node shared by all the tasks, pipelines, scenarios, and cycles. Its scope is `Scope.GLOBAL`. That
    means there will be only one Sales history data node, whatever the number of cycles or scenarios. All the
    scenarios will share the same data pointed by the same data node.
    - The sales pipeline execution only depends on the current month (i.e., the cycle). The `trained model`,
    the `current month`, and the `sales predictions` data nodes have a `Scope.CYCLE` scope. In other words, all the
    scenarios from the same cycle will share the three data nodes. For example, for the February cycle, both
    scenarios with low capacity and high capacity share the three data nodes. The linked tasks (training and predict)
    can only be executed once for both scenarios.
    - Finally, since I have multiple scenarios to simulate various capacities for a single cycle, the capacity
    and the production orders data nodes must have a `Scope.SCENARIO` scope, so multiple scenarios do not share them.
