A `Job^` represents a single execution of a task. Each time a task is submitted for execution, a new _job_ is
created. A _job_ holds all the information related to its task execution, including the **creation date**, the
execution `Status^`, the **user function log messages**, and the **stacktrace** of any exceptions that may be raised.
