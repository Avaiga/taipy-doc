A [Job](../../../reference/#taipy.core.job.job.Job) represents a unique execution of a task. Each time a task is
submitted for execution, a new _job_ is created. A _job_ holds all the information related to its task execution,
including the creation date, the execution [Status](../../../reference/#taipy.core.job.status.Status), the user
function log messages, and the eventual exception raised.
