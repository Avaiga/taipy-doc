# Taipy's Core configuration

In the previous chapter, the main [Taipy Core concepts](../concepts/index.md) are defined.

Taipy Core is an application builder designed to help Python developers efficiently turn
their algorithms into an interactive production-ready data-driven application.

To build such an application, the first step consists in configuring the characteristics and the desired behavior of
your application and its entities.

!!! note "Reminder: Config vs Entities"

    Throughout the documentation, configuration objects are named **_configs_** (`DataNodeConfig`,
    `TaskConfig`, `PipelineConfig`, and `ScenarioConfig`), while runtime objects (`DataNode`,
    `Task`, `Pipeline`, and `Scenario`) are called entities.

    One thing to wrap your head around (it may not be very intuitive for everyone at first) is that
    the **configs** are really just configuration objects specifying the characteristics and behaviors
    of the runtime concepts they relate to. **Configs** can be seen as generators. Indeed, each
    **entity** is instantiated from a **config**. Note also that the same **config** can be used to
    instantiate multiple **entities**.

    More details on the **entities** are available in the [Entities](../entities/index.md) chapter.

    All configuration objects must be created before running Core service to avoid any conflict.

This chapter is dedicated to the configuration and focuses on the various **configs** objects. Its sections are
organized as follows:

- [Config](config.md) section introduces the `Config^` singleton class, the single entry
  point for Taipy Core configuration.
- [Data node configs](data-node-config.md) section describes the data nodes' configurations using
  the `DataNodeConfig^` class.
- [Task configs](task-config.md) section describes the tasks' configurations using the
  `TaskConfig^` class.
- [Pipeline configs](pipeline-config.md) section describes the pipelines' configurations using the
  `PipelineConfig^` class.
- [Scenario configs](scenario-config.md) section describes the scenarios' configurations using the
  `ScenarioConfig^` class.
- [Global config](global-config.md) section documents the global configuration fields and the
  `GlobalAppConfig^` class.
- [Job orchestration config](job-config.md) section documents the configuration of the job orchestration
  using the `JobConfig^` class.
- [Config checker](config-checker.md) section presents the configuration checkers.
- [Advanced configuration](advanced-config.md) section provides details on advanced configuration
  features, particularly the capacity to overwrite configuration fields with _TOML_ files.
