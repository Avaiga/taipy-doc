Taipy Core is an application builder that converts user algorithms into a back-end application. To build such
an application with the desired behaviors, a few Taipy entities must be configured.

The following sections show how to configure a Taipy application in python. All The taipy configuration methods can
easily be imported from the Taipy main module as follows:

```python
import taipy as tp
```

!!! Note
    Note that you can override the python configuration using _TOML_ files. (More details on the
    [advanced configuration](advanced-config.md)) page.
