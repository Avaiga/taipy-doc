# Task attributes

The task creation method returns a [`Task`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.task.task.Task) entity. It is identified
by a unique
identifier named `id` that is generated by Taipy.
A task also holds various properties accessible as an attribute of the task:

- `task.config_name` is the name of the scenario configuration.
- `task.function` is the function that will take data from input data nodes and return data that should go
inside the output data nodes .
- `task.input` is the list of input data nodes.
- `task.output` is the list of output data nodes.

!!! Example
    ```python linenums="1"
        import taipy as tp
        from config import *

        scenario = tp.create_scenario(monthly_scenario_cfg)
        task = scenario.predicting

        # the config_name is an attribute of the task and equals "task_configuration"
        task.config_name

        # the function which is going to be executed with input data nodes and return value on output data nodes.
        task.function # predict

        # input is the list of input data nodes of the task
        task.input # [trained_model_cfg, current_month_cfg]

        # output is the list of input data nodes of the task
        task.output # [trained_model_cfg]

        # the current_month data node entity is exposed as an attribute of the task
        current_month_data_node = task.current_month
    ```

Taipy exposes multiple methods to manage the various tasks.

# Get Tasks

The first method to get a job is from its id by using the [`taipy.get`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get) method

```python linenums="1"
import taipy as tp
from taipy.core.scheduler.scheduler import Scheduler
from config import *

scenario = tp.create_scenario(monthly_scenario_cfg)
task = scenario.predicting
task_retrieved = tp.get(task)
# task == task_retrieved
```

On the previous code, the two variables `task` and `task_retrieved` are equals.

A task can also be retrieved from a scenario or a pipeline, by accessing the task config_name attribute.

```python linenums="1"
    task_1 = scenario.predicting
    pipeline = scenario.sales
    task_2 - pipeline.predicting
    # task_1 == task_2
```

All the jobs can be retrieved using the method [`taipy.get_tasks`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get_tasks).
