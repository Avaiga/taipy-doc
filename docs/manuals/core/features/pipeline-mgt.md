# Pipeline attributes

The pipeline creation method returns a [`Pipeline`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.pipeline.pipeline.Pipeline) entity.
It is identified by
a unique identifier named `id` that is generated by Taipy.
A pipeline also holds various properties accessible as an attribute of the pipeline:

- `pipeline.config_name` is the name of the pipeline configuration.
- `pipeline.subscribers` is the list of callbacks representing the subscribers.
- `pipeline.properties` is the complete dictionary of the pipeline properties. It includes a copy of the properties
of the pipeline configuration, in addition to the properties provided at the creation and at runtime.
- `pipeline.tasks` is a dictionary holding the various tasks of the pipeline. The key corresponds to the config_name
of the task while the value is the task itself.
- `pipeline.parent_id` is the identifier of the parent, which can be a pipeline, scenario, cycle or None.
- Each property of the `pipeline.properties` dictionary is also directly exposed as an attribute.
- Each nested entity is also exposed as an attribute of the pipeline. the attribute name corresponds to the config_name
    of the nested entity.

!!! Example

    ```python linenums="1"
        import taipy as tp
        from datetime import datetime
        from config import *

        pipeline = tp.create_pipeline(sales_pipeline_cfg,name="Pipeline for sales prediction")

        # the config_name is an attribute of the pipeline and equals "pipeline_configuration"
        pipeline.config_name
        # There was no subscription, so subscribers is an empty list
        pipeline.subscribers # []
        # The properties dictionary equals {"name": "Pipeline for sales prediction"}. It contains all the properties,
        # including the `name` provided at the creation
        pipeline.properties # {"name": "Pipeline for sales prediction"}
        # The `name` property is also exposed directly as an attribute. It equals "Pipeline for sales prediction"
        pipeline.name
        # the training task entity is exposed as an attribute of the pipeline
        training_task = pipeline.training
        # the predicting task entity as well
        predicting_task = pipeline.predicting
        # All the tasks are also exposed as attributes, including the training task entity
        training_task = pipeline.training
        # The data nodes are also exposed as attributes of the pipeline.
        current_month_data_node = pipeline.current_month
    ```

# Get pipeline by id

The method to get a pipeline is from its id by using the [`taipy.get`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get)
method :

```python linenums="1"
import taipy as tp
from config import *

pipeline = tp.create_pipeline(sales_pipeline_cfg)
pipeline_retrieved = tp.get(pipeline.id)
pipeline == pipeline_retrieved
```

On the previous code, the two variables `pipeline` and `pipeline_retrieved` are equals.

# Get pipeline by config name

A pipeline can also be retrieved from a scenario by accessing the pipeline {config_name} of the scenario.

```python linenums="1"
# Configure the two pipelines
sales_pipeline_cfg = tp.configure_pipeline(name="sales", tasks=[training_cfg, predicting_cfg])
production_pipeline_cfg = tp.configure_pipeline(name="production", tasks=[planning_cfg])

# Configure and create the scenario
monthly_scenario_cfg = tp.configure_scenario(name="scenario_configuration", pipelines=[sales_pipeline_cfg, production_pipeline_cfg]))
scenario = tp.create_scenario(monthly_scenario_cfg)

# Get the pipelines by config name
sales_pipeline = scenario.sales
production_pipeline = scenario.production
```

# Get all pipelines

All the pipelines can be retrieved using the method
[`taipy.get_pipelines`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get_pipelines).
This method returns the list of all existing pipelines.

# Delete a pipeline

A pipeline can be deleted by using [`taipy.delete`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.delete) which
takes the pipeline id as a parameter. The deletion is also propagated to the nested tasks, data nodes, and jobs
if they are not shared with any other pipeline.
