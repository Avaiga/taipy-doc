# Scenario attributes

The scenario creation method returns a [`Scenario`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.scenario.scenario.Scenario) entity.
It is identified by a unique identifier named `id` that is generated by Taipy.
A scenario also holds various properties accessible as an attribute of the scenario:

-   `scenario.config_id` is the id of the scenario configuration.
-   `scenario.creation_date` corresponds to the date-time provided at the creation.
-   `scenario.is_master` equals True if it is a master scenario. False otherwise.
-   `scenario.subscribers` is the list of callbacks representing the subscribers.
-   `scenario.properties` is the complete dictionary of the scenario properties. It includes a copy of
    the properties of the scenario configuration, in addition to the properties provided at the creation and at runtime.
-   `scenario.cycle` is the cycle of the scenario.
-   `scenario.pipelines` is a dictionary holding the various pipelines of the scenario. The key corresponds
    to the config_id of the pipeline while the value is the pipeline itself.
-   Each property of the `scenario.properties` dictionary is also directly exposed as an attribute.
-   Each nested entity is also exposed as an attribute of the scenario. the attribute name corresponds to the config_id
    of the nested entity.

!!! Example

    ```python linenums="1"
        import taipy as tp
        from datetime import datetime
        from config import *

        scenario = tp.create_scenario(monthly_scenario_cfg, creation_date=datetime(2022, 1, 1), name="Scenario for January")

        # the config_id is an attribute of the scenario and equals "scenario_configuration"
        scenario.config_id
        # The creation date is the date-time provided at the creation. It equals datetime(2022, 1, 1)
        scenario.creation_date
        # Is_master property equals `True` since it is the only scenario of the cycle.
        scenario.is_master
        # There was no subscription, so subscribers is an empty list
        scenario.subscribers # []
        # The properties dictionary equals {"name": "Scenario for January"}. It contains all the properties,
        # including the `name` provided at the creation
        scenario.properties # {"name": "Scenario for January"}
        # The `name` property is also exposed directly as an attribute. It equals "Scenario for January"
        scenario.name
        # the sales pipeline entity is exposed as an attribute of the scenario
        sales_pipeline = scenario.sales
        # the production pipeline entity as well
        production_pipeline = scenario.production
        # All the tasks are also exposed as attributes, including the training task entity
        training_task = scenario.training
        # The six data nodes are also exposed as attributes of the scenario.
        current_month_data_node = scenario.current_month
    ```

Taipy exposes multiple methods to manage the various scenarios.

# Get scenario by id

The first method to get a scenario is from its id by using the [`taipy.get`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get)
method :

```python linenums="1"
import taipy as tp
from config import *

scenario = tp.create_scenario(monthly_scenario_cfg)
scenario_retrieved = tp.get(scenario.id)
scenario == scenario_retrieved
```

On the previous code, the two variables `scenario` and `scenario_retrieved` are equals.

# Get all scenarios

All the scenarios can be retrieved using the method [`taipy.get_scenarios`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get_scenarios).
This method returns the list of all existing scenarios. If a cycle is given as parameter, the list contains all the
existing scenarios of the cycle.

# Get master scenarios

[`taipy.get_master`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get_master) method returns the master scenario of the cycle
given as parameter.

[`taipy.get_all_masters`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.get_all_masters) returns the master scenarios for
all the existing cycles.

# Promote a scenario as master

To set a scenario as master, the [`taipy.set_master`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.set_master) method must
be used. It promotes the scenario given as parameter to the master scenario of its cycle. If the cycle already
had a master scenario it will be demoted, and it will no longer be master for the cycle.

# Delete a scenario

A scenario can be deleted by using [`taipy.delete`](../../../reference/#taipy.core.taipy.delete)
which takes the scenario id as a parameter. The deletion is also propagated to the nested pipelines, tasks, data
nodes, and jobs if they are not shared with any other scenario.
