# About

**taipy-rest** provides a Flask Api built on top of **taipy** for you to use Taipy via a REST Api.

This project is meant to be used as a complement for **taipy** and its goal is to enable automation through rest APIs of processes built on taipy.

## What is a Taipy REST Api

Taipy REST Api allows developers to create, update and remove Taipy objects such as scenarios through a REST Api.

## How it works

In Taipy, the REST Api is hosted as a Flask server. Taipy provides various endpoint that can be called to interact with the Taipy concepts such as scenarios, pipelines, etc.
