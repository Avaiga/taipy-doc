# Deploy your application with uWSGI and Nginx on Ubuntu

[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) is a GNU/Linux operating system that can run the Web Application Server
[uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the Web Server [Nginx](https://nginx.org).


## Ubuntu versions below 20.04

In versions before *Ubuntu 20.04*, the pre-installed Python versions are older than 3.8, the
oldest version supported by Taipy. If you are in that case, please install Python 3.8 or above.

## Prepare your machine

The following software should be installed on your target machine:

- *pip*: for installing Python3 packages.

- *uwsgi* and *gevent*: the Web application server and its workers that will run the Taipy applications.

- *nginx*: the Web server for the Internet exposition.

You can install all of these packages by running the following command:
```
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install -y python3-pip nginx
sudo pip install uwsgi gevent
sudo ln -s `pwd`/.local/bin/uwsgi /usr/bin/uwsgi
```

!!! Note

    If you are using a SQL database based on Microsoft SQL Server, you need to install your corresponding
    [Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/microsoft-odbc-driver-for-sql-server).


## Run the application locally

If you want to deploy the following application:
```
from taipy import Gui

Gui(page="# Getting started with *Taipy*").run()
```

This would be placed in a file called *app.py*.<br>
You need to create a *requirements.txt* file that contains:
```
taipy
```

On your local machine, start the application by executing the following:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
Collecting taipy
<-- Truncate -->
Successfully installed taipy
$python app.py
 * Server starting on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Serving Flask app 'Taipy' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on
<-- Truncate -->
```

The application is running locally; you can access it with the browser on the URL
[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

!!! note
    The message:
    ```
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
    Use a production WSGI server instead.
    ```
    may be issued by Flask because exposing an application on the Internet and developing an application
    locally have different requirements, mainly regarding security and reliability.<br/>
    This message is generated by the [Werkzeug](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/) WSGI web application
    library that Flash depends on and will disappear when using the Web server.<br/>
    Some versions of Werkzeug may even raise an exception in that situation, preventing you from running
    the application. You will then need to set the
    [*allow_unsafe_werkzeug*](../../../gui/configuration.md#p-allow_unsafe_werkzeug) configuration
    parameter to True (or set the *allow_unsafe_werkzeug* parameter of `Gui.run()^` to True).

## Prepare the application for deployment

Deploying your application to a remote environment needs a bit of configuration.

Make sure you turn off the Debug mode (which is the default) by setting the
[*debug*](../../../gui/configuration.md#p-debug) parameter of `Gui.run()^` to False.<br>
You must also inform Taipy not to run the application server on its own but rather delegate the
execution by setting the parameter [*run_server*](../../../gui/configuration.md#p-run_server)
of the call to `Gui.run()^` to False.<br>
The name of the variable where the Web application is stored is used in the *uWSGI* configuration:
this allows the Web server to load the Web application:
```
from taipy import Gui

gui_service = Gui(page="# Getting started with *Taipy*")
web_app = gui_service.run(debug=False, run_server=False)
```
In our example, we store this application in the variable *web_app* (see line 3)

Make sure you upload this code on your target machine and install your dependencies with *pip*.

!!! important "Entry point"
    The entry point filename and the application variable name are important for the proper configuration
    of the *uWSGI* Web application server. Please, keep them as is or adapt the configuration.


## uWSGI application server

To expose your application over the Internet, you must use *uWSGI* instead of Flask as the application server.
You would then leverage Nginx to expose the application.

*uWSGI* can be started manually. But, generally, it's better to start the application automatically when the machine
starts. To order to do that, you should use [Systemd](https://systemd.io/) which is installed by default on *Ubuntu*.

From the directory where *app.py* is located, run the following command to generate an adapted file for *Systemd*:
```
echo """
[Unit]
Description=App
After=syslog.target

[Service]
ExecStart=uwsgi --http 127.0.0.1:5000 --gevent 1000 --http-websockets --module app:web_app
WorkingDirectory=`pwd`
Restart=always
KillSignal=SIGQUIT
Type=notify
StandardError=syslog
NotifyAccess=all
User=`whoami`

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
""" > app.uwsgi.service
```
Then transfer this file to the correct folder by executing:
```
sudo mv app.uwsgi.service /etc/systemd/system/app.uwsgi.service
```

Now, you can start your application automatically at startup time of your machine by issuing the
following commands:
```
sudo systemctl start app.uwsgi.service
sudo systemctl enable app.uwsgi.service
```

The application is now running locally but is not accessible yet from the Internet.


## Exposing to the Internet

To expose your application on the Internet, you should use _Nginx_.
Change the content of `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default` with the following:
```
server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5000;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```
Then restart *Nginx*:
```
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Your application is now accessible over the Internet!

!!! note "HTTPS support"
    This configuration is only for HTTP. If you need an HTTPS connection, please read the [Nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).
