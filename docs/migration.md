# From 2.x to 3.0

1. In Taipy GUI 3.0, the `on_action` callback signature was unified across all controls: the third
    parameter (*action*) was dropped. The *payload* dictionary parameter that used to be in fourth
    place is now in third place and contains an *action* key that is set to the action name if you 
    used to use *action*.

2. In Taipy Core 3.0 we deprecated the `pipeline` concept in favor of 
    [sequence](./manuals/core/entities/sequence-mgt.md). This also means that `configure_pipeline` 
    from Taipy Config was removed, making it necessary to update your config code. Take for 
    instance the following config on `Taipy 2.4`:

    ```python title="config.py from Taipy 2.4 edition"
    from taipy import Config
    
    # Omiting multiply_task_cfg creation
    
    pipeline_cfg = Config.configure_pipeline(
        "pipeline_1",
        task_configs=[multiply_task_cfg]
    )
    
    scenario_cfg = Config.configure_scenario(
        "multiply_scenario",
        pipeline_configs=[pipeline_cfg]
    )
    ```

    Now, `configure_scenario` takes task configs as parameter in place of pipeline configs, so to 
    update the config above to `Taipy 3.0` is just a matter of:

    ```python title="config.py from Taipy 3.0 edition"
    from taipy import Config

    # Omiting multiply_task_cfg creation

    scenario_cfg = Config.configure_scenario(
        "multiply_scenario",
        task_configs=[multiply_task_cfg]
    )
    ```

    After migrating the code, we recommend that you take advantage of `Taipy CLI`
    [migration tool](./manuals/cli/migrate-entities.md).


# From 2.0 to 2.1

In Taipy version 2.1, the version management system has been introduced. For applications 
created with a Taipy Core version &#8804 2.0, the first time it runs with version 2.1 or later, 
no version exists, and so legacy entities are not attached to any version. The overall principle 
is to create a version the first time the application runs with Taipy 2.1 or later and to assign 
all the old entities to this version. Depending on the mode used to run the application,
(Refer to [versioning documentation](manuals/core/versioning/index.md) for details) we propose 
the following migration paths:

## Using default or development mode

Please refer to the [Development mode](manuals/core/versioning/development_mode.md) 
documentation page for more details on how to run Taipy in development mode.

The first time you run the application with Taipy 2.1 or later, if you use the _development_ 
mode which is the default mode, Taipy automatically creates an _experiment_ version with the 
current configuration and assigns all legacy entities to it. The version is named 
"LEGACY-VERSION". Depending on how you want to handle legacy entities, you can now manage your 
newly created version using the version management system. Please refer to the
[Version management system](manuals/core/versioning/index.md) documentation page for more details.

## Using experiment or production mode

Please refer to the [Experiment mode](manuals/core/versioning/experiment_mode.md) or
[Production mode](manuals/core/versioning/experiment_mode.md) documentation pages for more 
details on how to run Taipy in experiment or production mode.

The first time you run the application with Taipy 2.1 or later, if you use _experiment_ or 
_production_ mode, you can simply provide a version name to create a new version. All legacy 
entities are automatically attached to this version. You can now manage your newly created 
version using the version management system. Please refer to the 
[Version management system](manuals/core/versioning/index.md) documentation page for more details.
