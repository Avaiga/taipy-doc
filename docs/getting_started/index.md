# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Getting Started** guide for Taipy. Taipy is composed of two components that enable anyone to create entire applications:

- **Graphical User Interface builder** (Taipy GUI): allows any Python developer to create a complex and interactive GUI.

- **Scenario Management** (Taipy Core): implements a modern backend for any data-driven application based on your business case.
Three Getting Started are available. 

Three **'Getting Started'** are available to introduce these two components. These 'Getting Started' are all **independent** and can be followed without any previous knowledge of Taipy.
 
- [Getting Started with Taipy GUI](./getting-started-gui/index.md). It explains the basics of Taipy GUI. A multi-page NLP (Natural Language Processing) application is created along the way.

- [Getting Started with Taipy Core](./getting-started-core/index.md). It shows how to configure and execute code with Taipy Core and all the useful features included.

- [Getting Started with Core & GUI](./getting-started/index.md). This Getting Started has similarities with the previous aones. It is not necessary to have completed them before. It will use the power of both components to create a full Machine Learning application with just a few steps.
