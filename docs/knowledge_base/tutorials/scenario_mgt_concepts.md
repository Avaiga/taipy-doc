# Manage Data Pipelines with Scenarios

Build, control, and run your data pipelines effortlessly with Taipy. Taipy simplifies the 
process of designing pipelines, handling data, and coordinating data movement through a feature 
known as scenario management.

In Taipy, a Scenario is specifically crafted for modeling pipelines and data flows. It connects 
your data nodes (representing your datasets) with tasks (which are the Python functions you want 
to execute). Configuring these scenarios becomes a breeze when you use the user-friendly Taipy 
Studio interface.
