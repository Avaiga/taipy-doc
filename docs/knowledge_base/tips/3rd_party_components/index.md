## Integrate Third-Party Components

In the world of web development, it's often necessary to integrate third-party 
components into your applications. These components could be anything from interactive 
visualizations to videos or other web pages. This article will demonstrate how to 
effectively include these external resources in your web app.

## Example: Embedding a Sankey Diagram

Let's explore a practical example of how to integrate a Sankey Diagram into a web 
application. A Sankey Diagram is a visualization tool used to represent the flow of 
resources or information between multiple entities. It finds applications in energy 
studies, cost analysis, and network analysis.

In our scenario, we have a Python application that processes recruitment data, performs 
analysis, and generates a Sankey Diagram using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/), a Python library for interactive 
visualizations.

Here's a code snippet creating a Plotly object:

```python
def sankey_graph(df):
    # Process the data for the Sankey Diagram
    ...

    fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Sankey(
        node=dict(
            label=unique_stages2, 
        ),
        link=dict(
            source=sankey_pairs["source"],
            target=sankey_pairs["target"],
            value=sankey_pairs["count"],
        )
    )])

    fig.update_layout(
        title="Sequences per application",
        font=dict(size=12),
    )

    return fig
```

## Integrating the Sankey Diagram

To integrate this *fig* object in our web application, the HTML version of this object 
has to be created. Here is the code that does that:

```python
import io

def expose_plotly(fig):
    buffer = io.StringIO()
    fig.write_html(buffer)
    return buffer.getvalue()
```

In this code, the function *expose_plotly()* is responsible for converting a Plotly
object (*fig*) to HTML. This conversion is a mandatory step in the 
process of integrating any third party component into your application.

The *fig* object is transformed into HTML, and then we proceed to define two callback 
functions, namely, *on_user_content()* and *on_init()*. The *on_init()* callback serves as a 
fundamental Taipy callback that is triggered when a new user connects to the application. 
On the other hand, the *on_user_content()* function is designed to return the HTML content 
to be rendered, while the *get_user_content_url()* function is invoked to obtain the URL 
for rendering the HTML content.

```python
uc_url = None

def on_user_content(state, path: str, query: dict):
    return expose_plotly(sankey_graph(data))

def on_init(state):
    state.uc_url = get_user_content_url(state, "val", {"name": "param"})
```

Finally, we can embed the Sankey Diagram within our web application using the 
following `part` component:

```
<|part|page={uc_url}|>
```

You can adjust the layout by changing its width and height. This element seamlessly integrates the Sankey 
Diagram into your web app, providing an engaging user experience.

## Conclusion

Incorporating third-party components into your web applications is a powerful technique 
that can greatly enhance user engagement. You can achieve this by converting external 
content into HTML and seamlessly integrating it into your web app.

This article demonstrated how to embed a Sankey Diagram in your web application using 
this method. This approach ensures that the integrated content doesn't interfere with 
your page and provides a secure user experience.
