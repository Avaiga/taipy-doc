Through these two videos, we take you on a journey to create interactive image 
classification applications using Taipy, [Nvidia CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)
, and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

## Video 1: [Building an Interactive Image Classification Application with Taipy and Nvidia CUDA](https://youtu.be/WWBmd-yG4B8?si=mnpkGpiMEfJT6EMD)

This beginner-to-intermediate level tutorial will walk you through wrapping a Deep Learning Image Classifier 
with interactive graphics.


## Video 2: [Interactive Image Classification with Taipy](https://youtu.be/iICxa4tK9jk?si=fi42idYdQv_EVac5)

In the second video, we'll dive into creating custom pipelines with Taipy back-end and TensorFlow
to enhance your machine learning workflows.

```$pip install taipy```
