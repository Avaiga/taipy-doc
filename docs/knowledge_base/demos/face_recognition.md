# Understanding the Application

This one page demo provides real-time face detection capabilities 
thanks to the robust [OpenCV library](https://opencv.org/). 


## How to use the Application

1. While opening the application, you'll see yourself across your webcam. A red square 
   surrounding your face with someone else's name.
   
2. Train the model to recognize you by clicking the "Capture" button and giving your name 
   several times.
   
3. Click now the "Re-train" button. Your name should now appear. The model recognizes you now.
