# Understanding the Application
This application shows a list of credit card transactions. The user can select a date range to
predict fraud. The application will then use an XGB model to mark potentially fraudulent
transactions in red or yellow.

The user can select a transaction to see an explanation of the model's prediction, as well as the client's
 other transactions.

The user can also choose the threshold of the model. The threshold is the output of the model
 above which a transaction is considered fraudulent. The user can choose the model according
  to the displayed confusion matrix and by looking at False Positive and False Negative transactions.
